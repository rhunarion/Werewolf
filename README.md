Minecraft Werewolf Plugin

This project is the plugin for Minecraft Bukkit server.  
You can enjoy WEREWOLF GAME, with many useful commands, graphical and hearing effects.  
If you want to play this plugin, access to **jinrou-mc.ddo.jp** in multiplay-mode of Minecraft.

This project is in progress, and maybe doesn't work exactly.  
In addition, would anyone help me to translate to English?
